# ML-Classification-Problem
The objective of this repositoryt is to evaluate your understanding and ability to apply supervised learning techniques to a real-world dataset. Dataset Used is the breast cancer dataset available in the sklearn library.

Key components fulfilled in this repository:

1.Loading and Preprocessing : Loaded the breast cancer dataset from sklearn. Preprocessed the data to handle any missing values and perform necessary feature scaling. Explained the preprocessing steps performed and justify why they are necessary for this dataset.

2.Classification Algorithm Implementation : Implemented the following five classification algorithms:
  (i) Logistic Regression
  (ii) Decision Tree Classifier
  (iii) Random Forest Classifier
  (iv) Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  (v) k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) For each algorithm, provide a brief description of how it works and why it might be suitable for this dataset.
  
3.Model Comparison : Compared the performance of the five classification algorithms. Which algorithm performed the best and which one performed the worst?
